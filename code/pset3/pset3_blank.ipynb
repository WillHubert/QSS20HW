    "You notice that the pharmaceutical kickbacks press release we analyzed in question 1 was for an indictment, and that in the original data, there's not a clear label for whether a press release outlines an indictment (charging someone with a crime), a conviction (convicting them after that charge either via a settlement or trial), or a sentencing (how many years of prison or supervised release a defendant is sentenced to after their conviction).\n",

    "You want to see if you can identify pairs of press releases where one press release is from one stage (e.g., indictment) and another is from a different stage (e.g., a sentencing).\n",

    "You decide that one way to approach is to find the pairwise string similarity between each of the processed press releases in `doj_subset`. There are many ways to do this, so Google for some approaches, focusing on ones that work well for entire documents rather than small strings.\n",
